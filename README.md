# Scientific Visualisation
My personal playground for crafting beautiful and jaw-dropping plots that make research sing and dance! Gone are the days of dull, lifeless figures. With this toolkit, you can dazzle your audience, impress your peers, and maybe even make your pet proud (no promises on that last one, though).

## Font

Font is like clothes for your data. It can make your data look good, or it can make it look bad.

<table style="width: 100%;">
  <tr>
    <td style="width: 50%; text-align: center;">
      <img src="images/correcting_precision_custom_font.png" alt="Custom Font" style="width: 100%;"/>
      <p>Correcting Precision with Custom Font (Avenir Black)</p>
    </td>
    <td style="width: 50%; text-align: center;">
      <img src="images/correcting_precision_system_font.png" alt="System Font" style="width: 100%;"/>
      <p>Correcting Precision with System Font</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>



Just like you would choose the right outfit to wear for a specific occasion, you should choose the right font for your scientific visualization. The right font can help to make your data look clear, organized, and easy to understand. The wrong font can make your data look cluttered, confusing, and difficult to read.

So next time you are creating a scientific visualization, take some time to choose the right font. Your data will thank you for it!

P.S. If you want your data to look really fly, Avenir is a good option. It's the font that made Steve Jobs' NeXT computer look so stylish.
